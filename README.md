## Algs4 Solutions

This repository is for sharing my solutions to the problems in the Algorithms, Part I course offered by Princeton on Coursera:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1

These are standalone implementations according to the problem specifications and I have not included here the scripts and
dependencies necessary for running them locally. In order to run this code locally, you will need to follow the course
instructions for your operating system to install lift - the instructions for installing on Linux can be found here:
https://lift.cs.princeton.edu/java/linux/


You will then need to download the project files for the problem for which you would like to run my implementation.
The download link is marked 'Project' and can be found at the top righthand of the specification page for the project.
